The Execution Manual
10 Structure Enforcer enforces one execution model:
Break → Acceptance → Retest → Reject.
This model is not predictive.
It is procedural.
The purpose is to reduce impulsive entries and emotional exits by requiring defined structural confirmation before participation.

I. The BARR Model
1. Break
A Break occurs when price moves through a defined structural level with strength and clarity.
A valid Break requires:
• Clear displacement beyond structure
• Momentum sufficient to demonstrate initiative
• No immediate rejection back inside prior range
Common violation:
Entering before the level is clearly breached.

2. Acceptance
Acceptance confirms that price is holding beyond the broken level.
A valid Acceptance requires:
• Sustained trading beyond the break
• No immediate reversal back through structure
• Evidence that the level is being defended
Common violation:
Entering during the first push without confirmation.

3. Retest
Retest verifies whether the broken level now functions as support or resistance.
A valid Retest requires:
• Price revisiting the level
• Controlled pullback behavior
• Lack of aggressive invalidation
Common violation:
Chasing continuation without waiting for retest.

4. Reject
Reject defines entry confirmation.
A valid Reject requires:
• Clear response off the retest level
• Defined invalidation point
• Risk determined before entry
Common violation:
Entering without defined invalidation.

II. Structural Standards
The following standards apply to all trades logged within 10 Structure Enforcer.
1. Trade only qualified structure.
2. Protect green from turning red.
3. Exit immediately upon structural invalidation.
4. Do not move stops to avoid loss.
5. Log every rule violation.
6. Trigger reset after emotional trades.
7. Review execution weekly.
8. Improve one behavioral weakness at a time.
9. Do not override predefined risk.
10. Discipline precedes outcome.

These standards are behavioral requirements, not market forecasts.

III. Enforcement Philosophy
10 Structure Enforcer does not provide:
• Trade signals
• Entry alerts
• Market predictions
• Investment advice
The application functions as a behavioral tracking and enforcement system.
Its purpose is to measure execution discipline, identify violations, and promote consistent structure adherence.
Results depend on the user’s own decision-making and risk management.
The system measures compliance.
It does not generate edge.
